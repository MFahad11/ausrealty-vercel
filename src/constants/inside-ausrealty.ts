Two estate agents came to pitch their services. The first talked a lot about their sales and how great their brand was, but my parents didn’t connect with any of it. The second agent did the same, and neither of them tried to understand our situation. I didn’t get why agents acted this way. My dad never forgot that."',

During that time, I learned the power of belief. Afterwards, I found myself working in a factory at 4 AM, feeling unfulfilled. Wanting more, I became an assistant to a real estate agent. My first task was to knock on doors. Though I was shy, I listened to people’s stories about selling their homes, which helped me believe in myself and find my true path".',

When it became clear that my soccer career was over and the company I worked for closed down, I began to contemplate my next steps. At 24, I took the leap to create Ausrealty with my now wife, Mel. Our first office space was in Carlingford, fuelled by the belief that I could achieve my goals. Despite having no prior experience, I opened the company, driven by my innate ability to connect with people and help them".',

        text:`Ausrealty was growing, almost out of control. I had driven past her old office many times and always saw her working late; I just knew she would be perfect for us. One day, I walked in and said, "We are growing something special, Australia-wide—who knows, maybe even worldwide. It's about belief, and I would love for you to help us." I was enthusiastic, but she replied, "No." Eventually, she agreed. You could say Ausrealty was founded twice. Moments happen in life where you find yourself connected to someone in a world of over seven billion people—it's all intertwined."`,

        text:`"Carlingford was a lesson in overextending. It was our furthest office, and while business and management were great, the energy drained as staff numbers dwindled. Eventually, just two young ladies were left coming in every day, while our other offices buzzed with activity. The team felt disconnected despite having management there, and attempts to manage them remotely didn’t align with our values of empathy and support.
With seven months left on the lease, we decided to close the office but honoured the remaining rent. We moved the team to Riverwood, where their mental health and performance improved. Closing Carlingford came at a cost, but prioritising people over money was the right decision".`,

For a week, I experimented with colours and styles, stood next to it, and took photos over and over again. People told me it wasn’t important and to focus on what matters, but I thought, what could be more important than my imagination? Only you know what can ignite your creativity; sometimes, visualisation grows".`,
