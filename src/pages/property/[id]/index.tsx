            "When designing this home, I focused on craftsmanship and durability. The Venetian plaster walls add texture, while the large windows were positioned to flood the interior with natural light and perfectly frame the waterfront views. The pool area was integrated into the design, with the surrounding stonework and glass balustrades enhancing the seamless flow between the home and the water. Every detail, from the lighting to the layout, was chosen to maximise the connection to the environment, blending indoor and outdoor living effortlessly." - Owner - This newly completed residence, designed by Dezcon, encapsulates Mediterranean-inspired elegance with a seamless flow between indoor and outdoor spaces.
